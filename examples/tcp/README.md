# Example: `tcp`

This is an example of how to use [componentize-py] and [Wasmtime] to build and
run a Python-based component targetting the [wasi-cli] `command` world and
making an outbound TCP request using `wasi-sockets`.

[componentize-py]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py
[Wasmtime]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime
[wasi-cli]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-cli

## Prerequisites

* `Wasmtime` 17.0.0 or later
* `componentize-py` 0.12.0rc1

Below, we use [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)'s `cargo` to install `Wasmtime`.  If
you don't have `cargo`, you can download and install from
https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/tag/v17.0.0.

```
cargo install --version 17.0.0 wasmtime-cli
pip install componentize-py==0.12.0rc1
```

## Running the demo

First, in a separate terminal, run `netcat`, telling it to listen for incoming
TCP connections.  You can choose any port you like.

```
nc -l 127.0.0.1 3456
```

Now, build and run the example, using the same port you gave to `netcat`.

```
componentize-py -d ../../wit -w wasi:cli/command@0.2.0 componentize app -o tcp.wasm
wasmtime run --wasm component-model --wasi inherit-network tcp.wasm 127.0.0.1:3456
```

The program will open a TCP connection, send a message, and wait to receive a
response before exiting.  You can give it a response by typing anything you like
into the terminal where `netcat` is running and then pressing the `Enter` key on
your keyboard.
